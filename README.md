# Bank Loan Dashboard - Power BI

## Problem Statement
This project aims to create an interactive **Bank Loan Report** to assess the bank's lending performance. The dashboard will track key loan metrics, such as loan applications, funded amounts, loan repayments, and customer demographics. By visualizing these metrics, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize the bank's lending strategies.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Loan Applications**: Track total, Month-to-Date (MTD), and Month-over-Month (MoM) loan applications.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Monitor the total funds disbursed as loans and MTD MoM changes.
- **Amount Received**: Assess the total amount received from borrowers, including MTD MoM variations.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Track average interest rates across loans and MTD MoM trends.
- **Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**: Evaluate average borrower DTI and MoM fluctuations.
